## Genetic Diseases — A Global Challenge

Genetic diseases arise from mutations that disrupt normal gene function, leading to altered or missing proteins and a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes. Although each rare disorder affects only a small number of individuals, collectively they impact millions worldwide. Advances in genome sequencing have identified causal mutations for most monogenic diseases, yet translating this knowledge into effective therapies remains a major challenge.

Traditional pharmacological treatments generally address symptoms rather than the underlying genetic defect. In contrast, gene-based therapies aim to correct or replace defective DNA, offering the potential for durable, one-time cures. However, despite major advances in genome editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas, base editing, and prime editing, the field still faces substantial technical and economic barriers.

### Poor Economics of Genetic Medicines and the Importance of Poly-allelic Variants

The development of genetic medicines is constrained by both scientific and market factors. Current editing tools typically target a single allelic variant, limiting each therapeutic to a small patient subset. This narrow applicability makes it difficult to build a viable business model, as the addressable market per variant is extremely small. To bring life-saving treatments to patients with rare genetic diseases, a platform is needed that can correct or replace entire genes and thereby address multiple allelic variants of a given disorder.

Bridge recombinases represent a promising approach to overcome this limitation. These RNA-guided DNA recombinases can insert large DNA fragments at specific genomic sites without creating double-stranded breaks. Their programmability and ability to restore full gene function independent of the causative mutation open the door to a new therapeutic modality: gene replacement therapy.

### Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency as a Proof of Concept

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) is an autosomal co-dominant disorder caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene. These mutations lead to reduced levels or misfolding of the α1-antitrypsin protein, a key inhibitor of neutrophil elastase in the lungs and liver. More than 150 pathogenic variants of SERPINA1 have been reported, including the common S (Glu264Val) and Z (Glu342Lys) alleles, as well as numerous rare or population-specific mutations. This high allelic diversity makes A1ATD an ideal model to demonstrate the potential of poly-allelic gene correction strategies.

Clinically, A1ATD is often underdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with other respiratory and hepatic disorders such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or cryptogenic liver disease. The disease manifests as lung damage, caused by a lack of circulating α1-antitrypsin, and liver pathology, due to intracellular accumulation of misfolded protein.

Recent work by Beam Therapeutics demonstrated that in vivo delivery of a genetic medicine via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can restore α1-antitrypsin expression and reverse disease symptoms in animal models. However, their approach targets only the most common Z mutation, leaving most patients without an available treatment.

In this context, bridge recombinase–mediated gene replacement provides a universal therapeutic strategy. By inserting a healthy SERPINA1 cDNA copy at the endogenous locus, it could restore gene function regardless of the underlying mutation, establishing A1ATD as a powerful proof-of-concept for next-generation genetic medicines.
