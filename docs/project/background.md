## Genetic Diseases: A Global Challenge

Genetic diseases arise from alterations in the DNA sequence that compromise normal gene function, leading to abnormal protein expression or activity. They encompass a vast and heterogeneous group of disorders ranging from single-gene defects to complex, multifactorial conditions. Although each individual rare disease affects relatively few people, collectively such disorders are estimated to impact more than 300 million individuals worldwide. The rapid progress of next-generation sequencing has enabled the identification of the molecular causes for most monogenic diseases, yet translating this genetic knowledge into effective therapies remains one of the central challenges of modern medicine.

Conventional treatments, such as enzyme replacement, protein supplementation, or small-molecule drugs, often alleviate symptoms but do not address the underlying genetic defect. In contrast, gene-based therapies aim to restore normal function by directly repairing or replacing defective DNA. Over the past decade, programmable nucleases such as ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas9 have revolutionized the field by enabling targeted genome modification with base-pair precision. These tools can disrupt, correct, or insert small DNA fragments and have already demonstrated curative potential for several monogenic disorders. However, significant obstacles remain, including limited efficiency in post-mitotic tissues, risks of off-target effects, and the persistent difficulty of delivering large or complex edits safely and effectively in vivo.

Gene editing therefore represents both a scientific and translational frontier. The ability to correct disease-causing mutations at their source promises durable cures, but achieving broad clinical applicability will require technologies that go beyond single-variant repair. Approaches capable of large-scale and allele-independent gene correction could overcome the fundamental limitations of current genome editors and reshape the therapeutic landscape for rare genetic diseases.

## Poor Economics of Genetic Medicines and the Importance of Poly-allelic Variants

The development of genetic medicines faces not only scientific but also economic challenges. Current editing platforms typically target a single allelic variant, meaning each therapy can address only a small subset of affected individuals. This limited scope restricts the market size for each therapeutic candidate and makes it difficult to justify the high costs of research, manufacturing, and clinical development. To make gene therapies accessible to patients with rare disorders, new modalities are required that can treat multiple allelic variants within the same gene or disease context.

Technologies capable of addressing this challenge could transform the economics of genetic medicine. A platform that enables full gene replacement, rather than single-point correction, would allow one therapeutic construct to serve many patients regardless of their specific mutation. Such an approach would not only improve scalability and cost-efficiency but also expand therapeutic reach to previously untreatable diseases.

## Bridge Recombinases: A New Class of Programmable Genome Editors

Bridge recombinases represent a newly discovered class of RNA-guided DNA recombinases that mediate precise DNA rearrangements through a mechanism distinct from nuclease-based genome editing. Originating from the IS110 family of mobile genetic elements, these enzymes couple a DEDD-family recombinase with a structured non-coding RNA known as a bridge RNA (bRNA). The bridge RNA contains two internal loops that independently base-pair with a genomic target site and a donor DNA, bringing the two DNA molecules into proximity to enable site-specific recombination. This reaction can perform three fundamental genomic operations—insertion, excision, and inversion—without creating double-stranded breaks or relying on host DNA repair pathways.

Because bridge recombinases use RNA-guided recognition rather than fixed protein–DNA contacts, their targeting is inherently modular and programmable. Altering the sequence of the RNA guide is sufficient to redirect recombination to a new genomic locus. This broadens the concept of nucleic acid-guided editing beyond CRISPR and extends it into the domain of large-fragment DNA integration. Unlike most current editors that are restricted to single-base or short-indel corrections, bridge recombinases can mediate the precise insertion of kilobase-scale DNA cassettes, making them particularly well suited for gene replacement therapies.

Two orthologs have been characterized so far, IS621 and IS110, both demonstrating programmable, sequence-specific DNA insertion and high efficiency in bacterial and mammalian systems. Their discovery establishes a new molecular platform for RNA-programmed DNA recombination that could overcome the size, efficiency, and scalability limitations of existing genome-editing technologies.

## Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency as a Proof of Concept

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) is an autosomal co-dominant disorder caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene. These mutations lead to reduced levels or misfolding of the α1-antitrypsin protein, a key inhibitor of neutrophil elastase in the lungs and liver. More than 150 pathogenic variants of SERPINA1 have been identified, including the common S (Glu264Val) and Z (Glu342Lys) alleles, as well as numerous rare or population-specific mutations. This high allelic diversity makes A1ATD an ideal model for testing poly-allelic gene correction strategies.

Clinically, A1ATD is often underdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with other respiratory and hepatic disorders such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or cryptogenic liver disease. The disease manifests as lung damage caused by insufficient α1-antitrypsin activity and as liver injury due to intracellular accumulation of misfolded protein.

Recent work by Beam Therapeutics demonstrated that in vivo delivery of a genetic medicine via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can restore α1-antitrypsin expression and reverse disease symptoms in animal models. However, this approach targets only the most common Z mutation, leaving most patients without a therapeutic option.

In this context, bridge recombinase–mediated gene replacement provides a universal therapeutic strategy. By inserting a healthy SERPINA1 cDNA copy at the endogenous locus, it could restore gene function regardless of the underlying mutation, positioning A1ATD as a compelling proof of concept for next-generation genetic medicines.
