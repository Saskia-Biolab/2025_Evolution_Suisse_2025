Technologies such as CRISPR or base editors can change individual DNA letters with remarkable precision, but they are not well suited for inserting or replacing long DNA fragments such as full-length genes. These methods often depend on creating double-stranded DNA breaks and letting the cell repair them, which can lead to unwanted mutations, low efficiency in certain cell types, or even larger genomic rearrangements <sup>2</sup>.  </p> <p>Many genetic diseases, including those affecting only a few thousand patients, are caused by a large number of different mutations within the same gene. Developing a specific therapy for each individual variant is costly and time-consuming. To make genetic medicine more accessible, we need tools that can insert an intact gene copy into its natural genomic position, regardless of the underlying mutation <sup>3</sup>.  </p>"},{"location":"#our-approach","title":"Our Approach","text":"<p>Our project focuses on a new class of genome editing enzymes called bridge recombinases. These enzymes combine a recombinase protein with an RNA molecule called a bridge RNA (bRNA) that guides the recombination process. The bridge RNA can bind to both the genomic target site and a donor DNA fragment. By doing so, it brings the two DNA pieces close together and allows the recombinase to join them precisely <sup>4</sup>.  </p> <p>Bridge recombinases share important features with CRISPR systems, as both use RNA to recognize specific DNA sequences. The key difference is in what happens afterward. CRISPR makes a cut in the DNA, and the cell has to repair it, whereas bridge recombinases perform a clean exchange without breaking both DNA strands. This has the potential to make the process safer and allows for the precise insertion of much larger DNA fragments<sup>2</sup> <sup>4</sup>.  </p> <p>To further improve these enzymes, we apply directed evolution, a laboratory process that mimics natural selection. Through this approach, we aim to evolve bridge recombinases that are faster, more accurate, and suitable for therapeutic use. Our proof of concept focuses on Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (A1ATD), a genetic liver and lung disease caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene <sup>5</sup>. The ultimate goal is to insert a healthy copy of this gene directly into its natural genomic position in human cells, offering a universal treatment that works for all patients, no matter which mutation they have.  </p>"},{"location":"#workflow","title":"Workflow","text":"<p>The first step in our workflow was the identification of suitable target sites in the SERPINA1 gene. We selected several positions that are highly conserved across patients and located them upstream of most known pathogenic mutations, ensuring that insertion of a healthy gene copy would restore function for all variants.  </p> <p>Next, we developed a computational screening method called deep mutational learning (DML) <sup>6</sup>. This method allowed us to explore thousands of possible sequence variations in the recombinase and identify promising candidates with improved activity using machine-learning. DML helped us understand the enzyme\u2019s fitness landscape and choose the best starting points for experimental evolution.   </p> <p>For laboratory evolution, we developed two directed evolution logics. The first, called E.coli Orthognoal Replicon (EcORep) <sup>7</sup>, uses a special DNA replicon inside E. coli that mutates at a high rate. Variants with higher recombination activity can be enriched over time, allowing the enzyme to evolve continuously toward better performance. The second system, Phage-assisted Continuous Evolution (PACE) <sup>8</sup>, uses bacteriophages whose ability to reproduce depends on successful recombination.

A depicts the mutagenesis plasmid, the O-Replicon and the selection plasmid in an E. coli cell. The mutagenesis plasmid carries the genes necessary for replicating the O-Replicon. The O-Replicon carries IS621 under the control of the inducible PVanCC promoter. The selection plasmid contains a casette with two antibiotic resistances, Gm resistance (GmR) and Kan resistance (KanR) facing in opposite directions. Depending on the orientation of the cassette, either GmR or KanR is transcribed. The cassette is flanked by donor and target sequences facing each other. This allows for IS621 + bRNA mediated inversion. B depicts the selection process. Cells are grown in LB liquid culture. IS621 expression is induced using vanillic acid (Van). Shortly before stationary phase, bRNA expression is induced by addition of aTc for bRNA A or OHC14 for bRNA B. Presence of IS621 + bRNA promotes recombination. Selection is performed by regrowing cells in media containing Kan or Gm. Cells that have successfully recombined express the correct AB resistance and survive, cells that did not recombine die. This process promotes the survival of bacteria carrying more active IS621 variants.  ## Target Sequence Selection As our proof-of-concept is to optimize bridge recombinase activity for AATD treatment, we identified three candidate target sequences (target 1-3) within the SERPINA1 locus. The targets were selected following these criteria:   (i) 14 bp-long sequences with a CT core in intron 1 as nearly all disease causing mutations occur downstream of exon 1 [cite]  (ii) excluded those with either direct match or 1 mismatch to any sequence in the _E. coli_ genome to reduce off targets  (iii) high similarity to the IS621 wild-type target sequence [cite Durrant et al]  To assess the baseline recombination efficiency between the wild-type donor and the selected target sequences, we co-expressed two plasmids in the _E. coli_ Marionette-Clo strain: one encoding the IS621 recombinase and another, the \u201dscreening plasmid\u201d, carrying the respective bRNA under the control of the PTet promoter along with two fluorescent reporter genes oriented in opposite directions (Figure 3A).  The screening plasmid expresses mGreenLantern under the control of a constitutively active promoter; after inversion the two fluorescent reporter gene cassettes are flipped and mScarlet3 is placed downstream the promoter and expressed. The recombination efficiency for each target site is measured by flow cytometry and calculated as the percentage of mScarlet3-positive cells. Inversion is induced by addition of aTc which triggers bRNA A expression.   After 15 h of induction targets 1-3 showed 6 % to 16 % of mScarlet3-positive cells, whereas, the non-targeted target-sequence showed &lt; 1 % positive cells (Figure 3B), confirming target-specific inversion events. Similarly, we observed &lt;1 % positive cells in the uninduced control in all conditions, except target 2 and 3, where we observed 2% positive cells at the 15 h time point. This is indicative of effective promoter repression in the absence of the inducer. Furthermore, we were only able to observe a change in fluorescent protein expression after 15 hours of induction, as there were &lt;1 % mScarlet positive cells 2 hours after induction across all conditions. Lastly, flipping events were confirmed by Oxford Nanopore sequencing. Target 1 showed the highest activity and was selected as the primary target sequence from this point forward.   ## Validation of the selection logic  To identify optimal induction and selection conditions for detecting IS621-mediated inversions, we screened nearly 100 conditions, with the most promising ones discussed below. We co-transformed the selection plasmid (pES013.2A) with a plasmid constitutively expressing IS621 (pES055.2). In this simplified model system, inversion is induced by the addition of aTc leading to the expression of the bRNA A. We first showed that the bacterial population maintains the selection plasmid in the absence of antibiotic selection by Gm or Kan in liquid culture over the course of 15 h (Figure 4 A). Based on this, we devised the induction scheme showed in Figure 4 C. ###### addd in figure 4C caption what the blue arrows mean!  The bacterial population was induced in late exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub>O=0.6). We tested two different conditions:       1. No antibiotic after induction      2. Kanamycin added after aTc induction to select for succesful inversions of the antibiotic cassette.   For each condition, controls in which bRNA expression was not induced were included.  Bacteria were grown for 15 hours after induction and then, those grown in absence of Kan were diluted into fresh media and grown for an additional 15 hours. This allowed for a longer induction period while minimizing cell death.  Notably, some bacterial colonies were already able to grow on Kan plates before induction (t=0), indicating a low level of pre-existing resistance in the native population (Figure 4 D (i)).  Following this assay monoclonal cultures were grown and their DNA sequenced. While the sequencing data confirmed inversion of the AB cassette, it also detected escape mutations, in some of the colonies grown in the presence of Kan.  Two escape mutations were identified: large deletions as well as insertions of genomic host DNA (5).  Upon deletion KanR gene was placed under the control of the pTet promoter, which otherwise controls bRNA A expression, enabling cell surivival without inversion of the cassette.   The second escape mutation we observed was a partial insertion of the transposable element IS150 from IS3 family [29]. This fragment contains a promoter which leads to the expression of KanR and cell survival.   #### Old text from report  After 15 h, the bacterial cultures induced with aTc showed more growth than their uninduced control. However, we observed significant growth in the uninduced conditions, particularly in the culture grown in the presence of Kan. Interestingly, after 30h, uninduced cultures showed no growth on Kan plates, whereas induced cultures grew.(4 D). Following this assay monoclonal cultures were grown and their DNA sequenced. While the sequencing data confirmed inversion of the AB cassette, it also detected escape mutations, in some of the colonies grown in the presence of Kan. Two escape mutations were identified: large deletions as well as insertions of genomic host DNA (5). The deletion placed transcription of KanR under the control of the pTet promoter, which otherwise controls bRNA A expression,enabling cell survival without inversion of the cassette. The second escape mutation we observed was a partial insertion of the transposable element IS150 from IS3 family [29]. This fragment contains a promoter which leads to the expression of KanR and cell survival. Figure 5: Schematic of escape mutants. In the unmodified selection plasmid, the resistance cassette is under the control of only one promoter. Gene deletion (A), off-target recombination or insertion of an exogenous gene sequence (B) may lead to re-localization of a second promoter downstream of the cassette. This can lead to the formation of escape mutants. Escape mutants express GmR and KanR simultaneously and thus no longer need to flip the cassette for survival during selection. During our selection experiments we found two escape mutants. One showed a large deletion. Both bRNAs where absent from the plasmid and the KanR gene was under the control of the PTet promoter. The the other escape mutants carried a fragment of IS150. The IS150 fragment contains an additional promoter and supports KanR expression.     ## Markdown footnotes for citations  Reference: [squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/data-tables/](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/footnotes/)  All footnotes will appear at the end of the page.
